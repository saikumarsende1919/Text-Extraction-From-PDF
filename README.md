# Text-Extraction-From-PDF
In this project, we will extract text data from PDFs using pdfplumber and PyPDF2 with Python. Key steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementing the necessary libraries. Additionally, we'll develop a web app to provide extracted data from uploaded PDF files.
