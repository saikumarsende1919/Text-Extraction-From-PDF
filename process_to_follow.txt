1. Create a requirements.txt file
Create a requirements.txt file in your project directory with the following content:

        streamlit
        pdfplumber
        pandas
        wordcloud
        matplotlib
        spacy
        
Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Include spaCy model installation in your script
Since the spaCy model en_core_web_sm needs to be downloaded separately, include instructions for
downloading it in your README file, or add a command to your script to download it if not already present.
Additionally, download the spaCy model en_core_web_sm:

        python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

 3. Complete Project Directory Structure

Ensure your project directory includes the following files:

/your_project_directory
|-- main.py                //pdfplumberapp.py 
|-- requirements.txt
|-- README.md
|-- sample.pdf # Optional: for testing   PDFs which we have 



4.Running the Application
Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

    streamlit run main.py
